        As a client, I want to buy products from your store.
        I have never been to the store so the items need to be arranged accordingly.
        The store will have aisles that contain a certain type of item (example: An aisles that contains fruits, an aisles that contains fish etc.).
        Each aisle will have shelves, and each shelf will have some products of that type(Fruits, fish, etc).
        In the end, after buying all the items, I want to know how much money I have spent in your store.
